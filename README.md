# Discord-bot-that-utilizes-fifteen.ai
This is a python discord bot that utilises POST requests made to https://fifteen.ai/app/getAudioFile which responds with wav files that are posted onto the server.

# Note
I haven't programmed in python in over 5 years. Expect to see some "what, why? Just, why" tier coding being done.

# What commands I will probalby try to do:

[Currently being worked on] "Hey x, say y"

[To be done] "Hey x, tell me about" (retreives a section of a wikipedia page and says it)

[To be done] "Hey x, [question] Text/ link to text/pdf link" 
Example Hey GlaDOS, tell me what you learned about the Spanish inquisition? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Inquisition
/\ From this I will try to parse the plain text and then run it through https://machinereading.azurewebsites.net/ (If allowed, gotta look into the legals of it)


[To be done] (Verbal) "Hey x, say y" (Voice chat version of "hey x say y")

[To be done] Again if its ok to do so I may look into using some things from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-lab


# For the love of God, don't missuse this in a stupid way. Please.
